SMS Spam Classification
This repository contains code for classifying SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

Project Overview
The SMS Spam Classification project involves preprocessing SMS text data and applying classification algorithms to predict whether a given SMS is spam or not. This project includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning and tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Building: Implements various classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate predictive models. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, sex, and ticket class, which are used to predict survival.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Creates new features and encodes categorical data.
Model Building: Implements classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
